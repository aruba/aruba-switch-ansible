# Example on how to use ArubaOS-Switch Ansible Modules to configure AOS-Switches in this Project setup
#
# Use via:
# ansible-playbook aoss_module_config_example.yml -e site=branchX -e state=STATUS
#
# Replace X with branch number you want to configure
# Repleace STATUS with "configure" to configure the switch and "unconfigure" to undo configuration done by the configuration part
